cryptall
========

`cryptall` is a small command-line interface helping you crypt, decrypt,
and brute-force various crypto algorithms with custom alphabets and dictionaries.

Supported algorithms are :

* Caesar
* Vigen√®re
* Affine

This project is conducted as part of my cryptology classes at University of Rouen.
